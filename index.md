# About Me
I am Ling WANG (<span style="font-family: 'MyKaiTi','KaiTi', '楷体';">王凌</span>), an incoming Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/dsai/">Data Science and Artificial Intelligence</a> at <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a> in January 2026, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.jibinwu.com/">Jibin Wu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/dsai/people/academic-staff/tankaychen/">Kay Chen TAN</a>. My work will focus on Multimodal LLMs, Bio-inspired DL, and Embodied Intelligence.

I got my M.Phil degree in <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/">AI Thrust of Information Hub</a> from <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou campus</a>, where I was honored to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cVDF1tkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Hui Xiong</a> (<a href="https://ailab.hkust-gz.edu.cn/index.html#about">IEEE/AAAI/AAAS Fellow</a>) and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AQtqhaYAAAAJ">Lei Zhu</a>. During my early studies, I was also mentored by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=SReb2csAAAAJ">Lin Wang</a> (later joined NTU, Singapore). I was also fortunate to work with Dr. <a href="https://chxy95.github.io/">Xiangyu Chen @ TeleAI</a>.

I got my B.Eng degree in <a href="https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/index.htm">Software Engineering</a> from <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/">Tongji University</a>, where I was privileged to work with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aYKQn88AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Wei Tian</a> at the <a href="https://github.com/tjiiv-cprg">Institute of Intelligent Vehicles @ Tongji University</a>.
